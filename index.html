        <p class=aboutdesc>I am a software engineer at Cisco Meraki in Austin. My passions are building applications and using my background in statistics to efficiently organize and visualize data. 
          My most recent projects were made using the MERN stack but I also have experience with Java, Python, C, and C++. 
          In my free time, you can find me DJing on the radio, performing improv, sewing, learning about film, or figuring out how to make the perfect loaf of sourdough.
